# ADGM Fintech GitHub Account

Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is an international financial centre based in Abu Dhabi.

Our GitHub account is a platform where developers can collaborate with us on cutting-edge projects, including OpenRegs, which provides machine-readable regulatory rules that we hope will help developers build new suptech and regtech tools, supporting regulatory compliance and automating regulatory processes.

We provide several initiatives and programs that welcome participation from the developer community, including the [RegLab](https://www.adgm.com/setting-up/reglab/overview), the [Digital Lab](https://portal-digital-lab.adgm.com/m/index.html#/), and our yearly [innovation challenges](https://www.adgm.com/media/announcements/adgm-innovation-challenge-hosted-by-fsra-opens-for-applications). The RegLab offers a regulatory sandbox for fintech startups to test their solutions, while the Digital Lab is a platform where developers can showcase their solutions to potential investors and partners. The innovation challenges are competitions that encourage and help to forge new partnerships between Corporate Champions and start-ups, developers and innovative service providers that are looking to transform financial services with their unique and pioneering solutions.   .

We encourage developers to explore the ADGM Fintech GitHub account and its repositories to find projects that match your interests. You can contribute to projects by submitting pull requests or opening issues.

We look forward to collaborating with you!
